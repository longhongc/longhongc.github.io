       I'm Chang-Hong Chen, a master's student in Robotics at the University of Maryland, College Park.
       My passion lies in software development for robotics systems, and I have worked on several projects,
       including the R&D of software for mobile robots and manipulators. My ultimate goal is to become a 
       robotics engineer who specializes in the architecture of robotics systems, from hardware mechanical 
       and electrical design to software and artificial intelligence.
