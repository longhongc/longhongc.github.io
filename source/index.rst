       Welcome to my virtual corner of the world! I'm Chang-Hong Chen, a master's student in Robotics at the University of Maryland, College Park.
       My passion lies in software development for robotics systems, and I have worked on several projects,
       including the R&D of software for mobile robots and manipulators. My ultimate goal is to become a 
       robotics engineer who specializes in the architecture of robotics systems, from hardware mechanical 
       and electrical design to software and artificial intelligence.

       As a lifelong learner, I am excited to share my knowledge
       and projects with you through this platform. In this portfolio, you'll find a collection of my work 
       that highlights my interests and skills. Whether you are an employer, collaborator, or fellow enthusiast,
       I invite you to explore my projects and get in touch if you have any questions or comments.
       You can use this :ref:`Contact Form <contact_form>` or connect with me on LinkedIn. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy your stay!
