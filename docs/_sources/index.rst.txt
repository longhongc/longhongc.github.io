      I'm Chang-Hong Chen, a master's student in Robotics at the University of Maryland, College Park.
      My passion lies in software development for robotics systems, and I have worked on several projects,
      including the R&D of software for mobile robots and manipulators. My ultimate goal is to become a 
      robotics engineer who specializes in the architecture of robotics systems, from hardware mechanical 
      and electrical design to software and artificial intelligence.
